<h3>Abstract</h3>

We wish to be able to take a picture of a rubix cube and determine what colors reside on each of the spaces on a face. Our approach was to take a picture and find the rubix cube by using edge detection, Hough Transform, then to use an algorithm to determine the color of each square. This was achieved with additional small steps described fully in the Approach.

<br><br>
<!-- Introduction -->
<h3>Introduction</h3>
In this project, we are trying to identify the colors on the face of a single Rubik's Cube. While it might seem easy for humans, we wanted to implment it withe Computer Vision topics. We are mainly using edge detection to find the edges of the cube, we are also using Hough transform to be able to find lines in the Canny edge detector output. In addition, we will be doing some color identification given 3 different lighting conditions. This can be used to eventually be able to solve a rubik's cube given video or picture imput.

<!-- Problem Statement -->
<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
In this project, we will be using computer vision techniques to be able to identify the colors in a single side  of a Rubik's Cube displayed in a picture. Our input will be a picture with one face of a Rubik's Cube showing. The output of our project will be a model outputted to the command line. This model will be able to define what colors are on the current side of the cube. Sample output is shown in the Approach section. For this project, we used openCV functions to do edge detection, Hough Transforms, and contours. The process of determining the colors and finding the bounding box was created by the group members of this team.

<h3>Approach</h3>
There was several steps to be able to identify the colors on the side of a Rubik's Cube. The first step was to find the edges in the image. We used the Canny edge detector, sample results are show below. 

Original Image:

Canny Edge Detector results:

</div>

To reduce the noise from the carpet, we applied a Bilateral Filter to the image to blur the image before applying the Canny edge detector.
Filtered Canny results:

</div>

From the edges found from Canny, we created a contour. From the countour, the Hough Transform was used to find lines describing the outer edges of the cube. This was done by finding the horizontal and verticle lines. The Contours are in white, the Hough Transform lines are in gray. 
<br><br>

</div>
After finding the max and min of the y intercepts and x intercepts of the Hough Transfom lines, a bounding box is created. To account for noise and other objects throwing off the bounding box, a squarify algorithm was written.

This is the image cropped to the box before squarifiy is called.

</div>
The image is then put into the squarify function where the function detects what it believes to be the corner of the rubix cube closest to the edge of the photo, and then reduces the longer side of the image to become a square. <br>
This is the image cropped to the squarified bounding box

<img style="height: 500px;" alt="" src="croppedSquare.jpg">
</div>
The image is then seperated into 9 sections where every pixel is looked at one after the other and compared to a self-gathered dataset to determine what color we believe that pixel is. The most commonly appearing color is then selected to be that section of the cube. Results are then outputted to the command line using a function that simply takes the results from the last function.

<h3>Experiments and results</h3>
When it came to testing our full data set with out fully implimented code, We found that of the 48 images we tested against, 34 were perfect identifications of the faces, two results only identified 8 of the 9 faces correct, and one sample only had 6 of the 9 faces correct. This led to a success rate of 75.9% with our data set. It is worth noting that a few examples in our "data" folder were not used. This is due to the image having multiple faces of the cube shown at once, which our code was not created to be able to handle. A graph displaying the accuracy of the algorithm is shown below.

<h3>Qualitative Results</h3>
The figures below show a sample output. This sucessful case shows the input and output of the application. As you can see, the application was fully correct when identifying colors.

However, the application had a hard time identifying the colors and the edge of the cube in this example (this is the darkest setting that we had)

<h3>Conclusion and future work</h3>
This report has described how our code takes an image of a rubix cube and using edge detection and color identification can, with a 75.9% accuracy rate, identify the colors of each of the faces shown in the image. However, this code is limited to pictures that only show one face of the cube. This report also has described how our code can struggle to detect the cube itself and how dark lighting in the photo has a large factor in the error rate of the code as well as other noise in the picture playing a role.
For future work, we would like to look into finding correlated parallel edges. Some issues arose from being able to identify perfectly up/down or left/right lines from the Hough Transform. When the image was not directly in frame, the algorithm had a hard time identifying the tilted edges as edges of the cube. On top of this, future expansions to this project could include features such as being able to identify multiple faces at once in the same picture, an option to construct a full cube from pictures, and taking that full cube and providing a list of moves to solve it.
